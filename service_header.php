<p>TCRcluster is a variational autoencoder and agglomerative clustering pipeline. It clusters TCRs together based on latent cosine distances extracted with a VAE.</p>
<p>If your file is properly formatted and you encounter an error, it is likely that you have duplicates TCRs in your dataset. TCRCluster-1.0 is not meant to handle exact duplicates.</p>
